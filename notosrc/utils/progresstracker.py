    Tracks progress through GTK animations

    Progress tracker is small helper for tracking progress through gtk
    animations. It's a simple zero-initable struct, meant to be thrown in a
    widget's private data without the need for setup or teardown.

    Progress tracker will handle translating frame clock timestamps to a
    fractional progress value for interpolating between animation targets.

    Progress tracker will use the GTK_SLOWDOWN environment variable to control
    the speed of animations. This can be useful for debugging.
